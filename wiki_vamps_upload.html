<H1> Instructions for VAMPS update </H1>

== Attention please ==
This web page is on [https://eelpond.mbl.edu/display/jbpc/Uploading+data+to+VAMPS the "official" JBPC wiki] now.

== Conventions ==
<p>
  On this page <b>bold text</b> used for command lines.<br/>
  <b><i>Italic font</i></b> means that you have to change that part of a command line with you own data.
</p>
<p><pre>This font</pre> used for literal lines, you can copy and paste them.</p>


== General comments ==
<p>
Run commands on domino, taiga, or tern and use "top" to check activity of the machine.
</p>
<p>
All the commands should be run in the latest directory under /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps, the one you've created in the [[#0_create_dir|01]]<sup>st</sup> step.
</p>
<p>
The "time" command is used to report the actual run time for various steps.
</p>
<p>
Create a "mail_done" alias in your .bash_profile (change the email address):
</p>

<p><b>
alias mail_done='echo "The `echo $STY` screen on `hostname` is done with its job." | mail -s "screen on `hostname`" <i>morrison</i>@mbl.edu'
</b></p>

<p>
"mail_done" will send you an email when the command from a screen session is finished.
</p>

<p>
Do the [[#0_create_dir|01]] first, then [[#1_454_to_transfer|02]]&#8211;[[#04_dump_intermediate|05]] sequentially, but you can start [[#07_upload_illumina|08]] simultaneously with [[#04_dump_intermediate|05]] on a different server.
</p>

<p>
Use "screen" session. 
</p>
<p>
If you want a screen log, use "screen -L" flag.  The log will end up in the directory where you issue the screen command.  
Or you can create a ~/.screenrc file:

<pre>
shell -${SHELL}
defscrollback 10000
deflog on
logtstamp on
screen -t "set_screen" 1 bash -l
autodetach on
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If you are running multiple sessions in the same directory, the log will have output from both.
</p>
<p>Estmated time is on the moment of writing this page, it will increase each time with the increasing amount of data.</p>

<H4>First-time Uploaders</H4>
<ol>
<li>
Request read-only permissions from Rich, with Anya's approval, to access vampsdb/vamps and bpcdb1/env454 databases.
</li>
<li>
SequelPro can be downloaded and used to connect to vampsdb as a fast and easy way to confirm the accurate transfer of data when commands are complete. The tables can be found in the "Content" tab. Alternatively, you can use a regular command line to access tables through MySql.

</li>
<li>In your home directory, create two files (note "." at the beginning of their names). Both keep your username/password information for MySql, but used by different programs.

<ol>
<li>

~/.my.cnf<br/>
<br/>
[client]<br/>
user="<b><i>USERNAME</i></b>"<br/>
password="<b><i>DATABASE PASSWORD</i></b>"
</li>

<li>
~/.dbconf<br/>
<br/>
<b><i>USERNAME</i></b><br/>
<b><i>DATABASE PASSWORD</i></b>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

== Uploading steps ==

<ol> 
<li id="0_create_dir"> Create upload directories
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>
      <p>Write the start date directory (e.g. "/xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/20150602") into a file </p>
      <pre>echo "/xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/$(date '+%Y%m%d')" >/xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt</pre>
    </li>
    <li><pre>mkdir `cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt`</pre></li>
    <li><pre>cd $(cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt); mkdir ill</pre></li>    
  </ol>
</li>

<!-- <ol> -->
<li id="1_454_to_transfer"> 
<p>If there has been any change to 454 projects (datasets renamed, regasting, etc.), do steps [[#1_454_to_transfer|02]] through [[#04_dump_intermediate|05]] (if only Illumina changed start from [[#06_start_Illumina|06]]):</p>

<p>Upload 454 data into vampsdb *_transfer tables.</p>

<p>Start or open screen in your home directory:
<pre>cd; screen -RL</pre>
<pre>cd $(cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt); time run_vamps_upload; mail_done</pre>
</p>

<p>Estimated time: 25 h.</p>

<p>This changes into the working directory in the "tovamps" directory, 
and uploads 454 data from env454 database to a temporary table in the vamps database.</p>
</li>

<!-- 02) -->
<li id="2_check"> Check that the upload completed successfully:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <!-- a)  -->
  <li> Look at the "check_vamps_upload.log" file.  The number of files should equal number of rows in the corresponding table.
  </li>
  <li> 
  <!-- b) -->
  If not, redo what's needed, run the command 
  <pre>check_vamps_upload_transfer.pl -t</pre>
   <p>to check again.<br/>
         If the numbers differ, it is likely because the connection dropped or some other communication error happened.</p>
        </li>
  <li id="2c_check_transfer"> 
  <!-- c) -->
  Check all transfer tables in vampsdb visually in SequelPro.  Look at *_transfer tables.
  </li>
  </ol>
</li>

<!-- 03) -->
<li id="3_transfer_to_intermediate"> Rename the "*_transfer" tables to "*_intermediate":
<pre>cd $(cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt); time swap_table_names.py 454</pre>
    
</li>
<!-- 04) --> 
<li id="04_dump_intermediate"> Dump the intermediate tables to a file on the server:

<pre>
cd /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/; module load mysql/5.6.12; time mysqldump -h vampsdb vamps new_class_intermediate new_contact_intermediate new_dataset_intermediate new_family_intermediate new_genus_intermediate new_orderx_intermediate new_phylum_intermediate new_project_dataset_intermediate new_project_intermediate new_species_intermediate new_strain_intermediate new_summed_data_cube_intermediate new_superkingdom_intermediate new_taxon_string_intermediate new_taxonomy_intermediate new_user_contact_intermediate new_user_intermediate vamps_data_cube_intermediate vamps_junk_data_cube_intermediate vamps_projects_datasets_intermediate vamps_projects_info_intermediate vamps_sequences_intermediate vamps_taxonomy_intermediate | gzip > vamps_prod.intermediate_from_454.`date '+%m%d%y'`.sql.gz; mail_done
</pre>

<p>Estimated time: 30 min.</p>

<p>This command does an SQL dump of the *_intermediate tables content to a file on server (the tables contain only 454 data at this point).  </p>

</li>
<!-- 05)  -->
<li id="06_start_Illumina"> <p>If there are only Illumina data changes, restore the 454 data from the existing dump file, e.g. <i>vamps_prod.intermediate_from_454.031815.sql.gz</i>
</p>

<p>Start or open screen in your home directory:
<pre>cd; screen -RL</pre>
<pre>cd /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/; FILE_NAME=`ls | grep -o vamps_prod.intermediate_from_454.*.sql.gz`; time gunzip < $FILE_NAME | mysql -h vampsdb vamps; mail_done</pre>
</p>

<p>Estimated time: 1 h.</p>
<p>Warning: The command line will work correctly only if there is only one file with such name. Remove or rename all previous ones.</p>

<p>This string of commands just finds the dump file's name and assigns it to the variable "FILE_NAME".<br/>
If you know the file name, you can put it into the mysql command without using a variable. E.g. "'''time gunzip < <i>file_name</i> | mysql -h vampsdb vamps; mail_done'''".</p>

</li>
<!-- 06)  -->

<li> Check if the vamps tables look ok (if not done in step [[#2c_check_transfer|3c]]).<br/>  
    Look at *_intermediate tables in vampsdb. It's easier to use SequelPro or similar visualization software. All tables should have information in them. Make sure columns match the information.

    </li>
<!-- 07) --> 
<li id="07_upload_illumina"> Upload Illumina data.

    <p>Start or open screen in your home directory:
      <pre>cd; screen -RL</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Change into the correct directory</p>
      <pre>cd $(cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt)/ill</pre>

	  <p>now upload the Illumina data to vamps db, into *_transfer and *_ill tables. This is similar to step [[#1_454_to_transfer|02]], but for Illumina.</p>
    <pre>time run_vamps_upload_ill; mail_done </pre>

<p>Estimated time: 28 h.</p>

</li>
<!-- 08)  -->

<li> <p>Check that the upload completed successfully:</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

    <li>
    <p>Look at *_intermediate, *_transfer, *_ill vampsdb tables using SequelPro. </p>
    <p>The *_intermediate should not have changed,  <br/>
    *_transfer and *_ill will have been recreated,<br/>
    all *_ill should have content. </p>
    </li>
    <li> Look at the "check_vamps_upload.log" file.  The number of files should equal number of rows in the corresponding table.
    </li>
  </ol>

</li>
<!-- 09) --> 
<li> <p>Add Illumina data to 454 in vampsdb tables.</p>

    <p>Start or open screen in your home directory:
      <pre>cd; screen -RL</pre>
      <pre>cd $(cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt)/ill; time swap_table_names.py ill; mail_done</pre> 
    </p>
    <p>This adds contents of the *_transfer and *_ill tables to *_intermediate tables.  </p>
    <p>It is similar to [[#3_transfer_to_intermediate|04]], but data are added to the existing *_intermediate tables; it is not overwritten.</p> 

<p>Estimated time: 12 h.</p>

</li>
<!-- 10)  -->
<li> Check to see that the entire process completed successfully.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>
    <!-- a) --> 
    Repeat [[#2c_check_transfer|3c]] visual check, look at *_intermediate, *_transfer, *_ill vampsdb tables using SequelPro.
  </li>
  <li id="10b_compare_interm_w_current">
    <!-- b) --> Run 
    <pre>python /xraid/bioware/linux/seqinfo/bin/vamps_upload_util/compare_interm_w_current.py</pre>
        <p>This checks table sizes.  If anything has been added, the new table size should be same or bigger than current version. </p> 
  </li>
  <li>
    Check if no old data get lost.
  <!-- c) --> 
   <pre>cd $(cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt)/ill;</pre>

    Run <pre>check_all_vamps_intermediate.sh</pre> and look into check_all_vamps_intermediate.log <pre>cd $(cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt)/ill; less check_all_vamps_intermediate.log</pre>
    
The script is looking for entries which are not in the new (_intermediate) table.<br/>
If output for any table is greater then zero - investigate (compare with amount of differences in the opposite direction and compare results, there should be more data in the new tables.) 
    
    E.g. <pre>SELECT * FROM new_contact_intermediate a 
      LEFT JOIN new_contact b USING(contact) 
      WHERE b.contact_id IS NULL;</pre>

Take a current query and change "RIGHT" to "LEFT" and  "WHERE a" to " WHERE b" to check other results with rows more then 0. The result of the second query should be bigger.

This script does not check vamps sequences - too slow, if needed you can run:
    
    <pre>SELECT count(*) FROM vamps_sequences_intermediate a 
      RIGHT JOIN vamps_sequences b USING(rep_id) 
      WHERE a.id IS NULL;</pre>
  </li>
  </ol>

<li>
<p>Change the front page of VAMPS site (only Andy or Anya can do this; skip this step).</p>
    <pre>vim /usr/local/www/vamps/docs/includes/notice.php</pre>
  <p>to uncomment the yellow notice (upload();)</p>
  </li>
</li>
    
<li> Rename the current tables to "previous" version and *_intermediate tables to "current".
    <pre>cd $(cat /xraid2-2/g454/vamps/tovamps/current_vamps_upload.txt)/ill; time swap_table_names.py rename; mail_done</pre> 

</li>

<li> Look at the new projects in VAMPS. Check heat maps, tax tables. Do they look reasonable?<br/>
  This query on vampsdb will give you the new project names:
  <pre>SELECT DISTINCT np.project 
  FROM new_dataset AS nd 
  JOIN new_project AS np USING(project_id) 
  LEFT JOIN new_dataset_previous AS pd ON (nd.dataset = pd.dataset) 
  LEFT JOIN new_project_previous AS pp ON (pd.project_id = pp.project_id AND np.project = pp.project) 
  JOIN vamps_submissions_tubes AS st ON (np.project = st.project_name AND st.dataset_name = nd.dataset) 
  JOIN vamps_submissions USING(submit_code) 
  WHERE pd.dataset_id IS NULL 
  ORDER BY project ASC</pre>
  
  <p>
  Or use http://vampsdev.mbl.edu/db_gui/ and select query "New project / dataset uploaded on VAMPS".
  </p>
</li>

<li> If you skipped step [[#10b_compare_interm_w_current|11b]], run another check on the numbers
    <pre>python /xraid/bioware/linux/seqinfo/bin/vamps_upload_util/compare_res_w_previous.py</pre>  
    <p>"res" = results (current). </p>
  </li>
</ol>
    
<p>Congratulations &#8212; you are done with the update.  Notify the investigators whose projects have been added or updated!</p>

== Some errors from log files ==

<ol>
<li> 
<!-- 1) -->
<p>Error: Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`vamps`.`#sql-be5_a36aa`, CONSTRAINT `#sql-be5_a36aa_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`project_id`) REFERENCES `new_project_transfer` (`project_id`))</p>

<p>One of tables was corrupted, ask Anya to investigate or rerun vamps upload.</p>
</li>
<li> 
<!-- 2) --> 
<p>Error: Lost connection to MySQL server during query<br/>
   Error: Table 'env454.vamps_sequences_transfer_temp' doesn't exist</p>

<p>   Because of the lost connection the table wasn't created and all further steps didn't work.<br/>
   Rerun vamps upload or just the last step (e.g. <b>run_vamps_upload_ill</b>) if there was no tables renaming yet.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
